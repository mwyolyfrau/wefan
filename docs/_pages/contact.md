There are a number of ways to get in touch. The simplest and quickest may be via Mastodon, where the project is [@mwyolyfrau@toot.wales](https://toot.wales/@mwyolyfrau)

Alternatively, you can email `cymraeg (at) jasbro (dot) io` and, if my mailbox is not too much of a singularity, you might well get a response.

Another easy way is to post an issue or [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/mwyolyfrau/discussions) over at our Github. [For issues with the website, try here](https://github.com/mwyolyfrau/wefan/issues). For other issues, choose an appropriate repository on which to log an issue and it will be seen.
