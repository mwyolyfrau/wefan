Croeso / Welcome

Mwy o Lyfrau is an open source project to translate copyright-free classic books into Welsh.

It uses a mixture of human and machine translation, with human editors reviewing all texts. Debate is encouraged over translations via GitHub Issues, and contributions via Pull Requests are the project's lifeblood.
