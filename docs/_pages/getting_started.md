Getting Started on translation can be a little tricky if you've never used Github or a similar hosted git repository before. Luckily, there are lots of resources to get you started.

#### The Basic Process 

First, you will need a Github account. If you don't already have one, now is an ideal time to go and get one. It is free.

The primary way to propose an edit is to [submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

Generally, you will need to do this [from a fork of the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) held in your own github space.

So:

- [Sign up or sign in](https://github.com/signup/)

- fork the repository you want to edit (if you haven't already)

- Make your edits in your forked copy

- Submit a pull request back to Mwy o Lyfrau's copy of the repository, including plenty of detail in your subject or description.

From there, your edits may be debated back and forth, or may be accepted as-is. They may even be rejected, and if that's the case, we'll endeavour to include a detailed reason why.
