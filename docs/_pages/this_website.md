Just like book translations, volunteers can edit this website. In fact, it is positively encouraged. To get started, you'll want to be familiar with forking, editing and submitting Pull Requests on Github, so the [getting started guide](getting_started.md) may be useful. You'll also want to [familiarise yourself with Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/quickstart-for-writing-on-github), which is how the website does its formatting in the background.
